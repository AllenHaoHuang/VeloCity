# VéloCity
**vélo [*noun, french*]**

    bike, cycle

**city [*noun*]**

    a large town.
 
The bicycle lies as one of the world's most important inventions. 
We aim to provide a bounding connection between a city, and its bicycles. 
Humanity deserves that - does it not?

### API
The optimal route-calculation API is hosted at http://api.velocity.shen.nz. The API is hosted at [this repository](https://github.com/williamshen-nz/VeloCity-API).

To query the API, simply request (GET): `/getRoute?origin=...&destination=...&option=...` where option = Safest, Shortest, Fastest, Scenic or DEBUG (case-sensitive).

DEBUG returns all potential routes and is, as its name suggests, used for debugging purposes.
